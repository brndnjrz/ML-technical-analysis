# 🎯 AI Accuracy Optimization Implementation

## Overview

This implementation follows the comprehensive accuracy optimization plan to improve AI prediction accuracy through systematic measurement, regime-aware fusion, structured vision analysis, and intelligent decision-making.

## 🚀 Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Metrics Tracking & Measurement (`src/utils/metrics.py`)

**What it does:**
- Logs every AI prediction with contextual data
- Tracks directional accuracy (1, 3, 7-day horizons)
- Measures range prediction accuracy
- Calculates calibration metrics (Brier score, reliability)
- Monitors risk assessment accuracy

**Key Features:**
- JSONL format for fast analytics
- Regime-specific accuracy tracking
- Strategy performance analysis
- Confidence calibration measurement

**Usage:**
```python
from src.utils.metrics import log_prediction, get_accuracy_report

# Log a prediction
prediction_id = log_prediction(ticker, recommendation, regime, market_data)

# Get accuracy report
report = get_accuracy_report(days_back=30)
```

### 2. Market Regime Detection (`src/ai_agents/hedge_fund.py`)

**What it does:**
- Automatically detects current market regime
- Uses ADX, moving average slopes, and volatility ratios
- Categorizes markets as: `trend`, `range`, or `event`

**Regime Logic:**
- **Trend**: ADX ≥ 20 + significant MA slope
- **Range**: Low ADX + oscillatory price action  
- **Event**: High IV/RV ratio or near earnings

**Benefits:**
- Regime-appropriate strategy selection
- Dynamic weight adjustments for fusion
- Better risk assessment

### 3. Structured Vision Analysis (`src/analysis/vision_schema.py`)

**What it does:**
- Enforces strict JSON schema for vision output
- Validates price levels against reasonable bounds
- Provides structured error handling and fallbacks

**Schema Features:**
- Pydantic validation with automatic type checking
- Price level sanity checks (±20% bounds)
- Confidence scoring with uncertainty handling
- Pattern recognition standardization

**Output Structure:**
```json
{
    "trend": "bullish|bearish|neutral",
    "support": [price_levels_below_current],
    "resistance": [price_levels_above_current], 
    "risk": "low|medium|high",
    "confidence": 0.75
}
```

### 4. Regime-Aware Fusion (`src/ai_agents/hedge_fund.py`)

**What it does:**
- Combines quantitative and vision analysis with regime-specific weights
- Applies calibration adjustments based on historical performance
- Handles confidence scaling and uncertainty quantification

**Fusion Weights by Regime:**
- **Trend**: Quant 70%, Vision 30% (favor momentum indicators)
- **Range**: Quant 45%, Vision 55% (favor pattern recognition)
- **Event**: Quant 60%, Vision 40% (favor volatility metrics)

### 5. Decision Thresholds & No-Trade Zones

**What it does:**
- Implements explicit probability thresholds for trade entry
- Creates no-trade zones to avoid marginal decisions
- Uses regime-specific decision criteria

**Thresholds by Regime:**

| Regime | Bullish Entry | Bearish Entry | No-Trade Zone | Min Confidence |
|--------|---------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| Trend  | ≥ 0.58       | ≤ 0.42       | 0.47-0.53    | 0.60          |
| Range  | ≥ 0.62       | ≤ 0.38       | 0.45-0.55    | 0.50          |
| Event  | ≥ 0.65       | ≤ 0.35       | 0.40-0.60    | 0.70          |

### 6. Enhanced Chart Generation (`src/utils/vision_plotter.py`)

**What it does:**
- Creates deterministic, labeled charts optimized for AI vision
- Consistent theme, fonts, and layout across all charts
- Automatic watermarking with key context

**Vision Optimization Features:**
- Fixed 800x800 resolution, <250KB WebP compression
- Clear panel labeling (PRICE, RSI, VOLUME)
- Distinct color coding for support/resistance
- Context annotations (current price, RSI condition, trend)

### 7. Options Strategy Optimization (`src/utils/options_optimizer.py`)

**What it does:**
- Scores option strategies across strike/expiry grids
- Calculates expected value using scenario analysis
- Includes transaction costs and slippage

**Grid Scoring Features:**
- Black-Scholes approximation for option pricing
- Multiple scenario P&L calculation
- Risk-adjusted scoring methodology
- Automatic strike/expiry optimization

### 8. Integrated Accuracy Reporting (`app.py`)

**What it does:**
- Real-time accuracy metrics in Streamlit sidebar
- Regime-specific performance breakdown
- Calibration and hit rate monitoring

### 9. Schema Validation & Adaptation (`src/utils/ai_output_schema.py`)

**What it does:**
- Enforces consistent structure for AI outputs
- Provides intelligent adaptation for non-conforming data
- Ensures graceful degradation with sensible fallbacks

**Key Features:**
- JSON Schema validation with descriptive fields
- Automatic adaptation of flat to nested structures
- Null value handling for numeric fields
- Fallback generation with appropriate default values

**Benefits:**
- Prevents crashes from malformed AI outputs
- Maintains consistency across different models and agents
- Improves reliability in production environments
- Enhances accuracy by standardizing data formats

**Usage:**
```python
from src.utils.ai_output_schema import validate_ai_model_output

# Validate and potentially adapt AI model output
try:
    validation_result = validate_ai_model_output(strategy_data, ticker="SPY")
    if validation_result and not isinstance(validation_result, bool):
        # Use the adapted data if validation transformed the structure
        strategy_data = validation_result
except Exception as e:
    # Fallback handling with appropriate default values
    logging.error(f"Validation error: {str(e)}")
```

## 📊 Accuracy Measurement Framework

### Metrics Tracked
1. **Directional Hit Rate**: % correct directional calls (1d, 3d, 7d)
2. **Range Accuracy**: % times price stays within predicted range
3. **Brier Score**: Calibration metric (0-1, lower better)
4. **Reliability**: How well confidence matches actual performance
5. **Risk Accuracy**: Alignment between predicted and realized volatility
6. **Strategy P&L**: Actual performance by strategy type

### Regime-Specific Tracking
- Separate accuracy metrics for each regime
- Identifies which approaches work best in different markets
- Enables dynamic model selection

## 🎯 Expected Accuracy Improvements

Based on the optimization plan, expect to see:

- **Directional Hit Rate**: +6-10% improvement over baseline
- **Range Accuracy**: ≥60% on range-bound days
- **Brier Score**: 15%+ improvement in calibration
- **False Positive Reduction**: Fewer marginal trades due to no-trade zones
- **Risk Management**: Better alignment between predicted and actual volatility

    market_data=market_context,
    vision_enabled=True,
    prompt_version="vA"

### Vision Analysis with Validation
```python
# Parse and validate vision output
structured_vision = parse_vision_analysis(raw_llm_output, current_price=150.0)

# Check validation status
if structured_vision.get('schema_validation') == 'passed':
    support_levels = structured_vision['support']
    confidence = structured_vision['confidence']
    trend = structured_vision['trend']
```

### Regime-Aware Decision Making
```python
# Detect market regime
regime = hedge_fund.detect_regime(data, ticker, options_data)

# Get fused probabilities
fused_probs = hedge_fund.fuse_agent_probabilities(
    analyst_view, vision_analysis, regime
)
