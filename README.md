## **What the Code Does**


### **1. Streamlit App Setup & UI**
- Modern, wide-layout dashboard with streamlined controls
- Sidebar features model selection and strategy configuration
- Real-time data fetching enabled by default
- Dynamic indicator selection based on strategy type




### **2. Inputs for Stock Ticker, Date Range, and Strategy**
- Enter a stock ticker (e.g., "AAPL")
- Choose start and end dates for historical data
- Select ML model type (RandomForest, XGBoost, CatBoost)
- Select timeframe and analysis type
- Choose strategy type and specific options strategy if applicable




### **3. Fetch and Display Stock Data**
- Stock data is fetched using `yfinance` for the selected ticker, date range, and interval.
- Data is stored in `st.session_state` for persistence and fast UI updates.





### **4. Technical & Fundamental Metrics, Charting**
