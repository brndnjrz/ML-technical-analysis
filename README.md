# AI-Powered Technical Stock Analysis Dashboard


## **Overview**
This project provides an **AI-powered technical stock analysis dashboard** built with Streamlit, Plotly, and advanced technical analysis tools. The dashboard features a modern, interactive UI, dynamic strategy and indicator selection, and AI-driven market analysis with PDF reporting.



### **Libraries Used**
- `streamlit`: For the interactive web dashboard
- `yfinance`: For downloading historical stock data
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and time series
- `plotly`: For interactive candlestick and technical indicator charts
- `ollama`: For sending chart images and prompts to an AI model (LLaMA 3.2 Vision)
- `tempfile`, `base64`, `os`: For temporary file management and PDF/chart handling



## **What the Code Does**


### **1. Streamlit App Setup & UI**
- The app uses **Streamlit** for a modern, wide-layout dashboard.
- The sidebar features a two-column layout for ticker and real-time data toggle.
- Users can select start/end dates, timeframes, and analysis types.
- Strategy and indicator selection is dynamic and context-aware.




### **2. Inputs for Stock Ticker, Date Range, and Strategy**
- Enter a stock ticker (e.g., "AAPL") and select real-time data if desired.
- Choose start and end dates for historical data.
- Select timeframe (1d, 1h, 30m, 15m, 5m) with recommendations for each.
- Choose analysis type (Options Trading, Buy/Hold/Sell, Multi-Strategy).
- For options, select trading timeframe and specific strategy (e.g., Iron Condor, Covered Calls).




### **3. Fetch and Display Stock Data**
- Stock data is fetched using `yfinance` for the selected ticker, date range, and interval.
- Data is stored in `st.session_state` for persistence and fast UI updates.




### **4. Technical Indicators & Charting**
- Interactive candlestick charts are created with Plotly.
- Sidebar allows dynamic selection of technical indicators, grouped by category (momentum, trend, volatility, volume, oscillators).
- Recommended indicators are pre-selected based on chosen strategy.
- Indicators include: SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, VWAP, ATR, ADX, Stochastic, OBV, and more.




### **5. AI-Powered Analysis & PDF Reporting**
- Uses the `ollama` library (LLaMA 3.2 Vision) for advanced chart and indicator analysis.
- When users click "Run Analysis ðŸ’¸":
  - The chart is saved as an image and sent to the AI model with a detailed, context-aware prompt.
  - The AI model provides a trade recommendation, strategy, and rationale.
- Results are displayed in the dashboard.
- Users can generate a comprehensive PDF report (with chart, analysis, indicators, and risk metrics) for preview and download.




### **6. Temporary File & State Management**
- Temporary files for charts and PDFs are managed and cleaned up automatically.
- All user selections and results are managed via Streamlit session state for a seamless experience.
